Hi!

I'm Uma Subbiah and I'm currently a software engineer at McDonald's Corporation, where I work on the backend handling of placing an order via the app. Prior to this, I worked at a startup in the Bay Area. 

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, UK, where I graduated with Distinction. My masters thesis applied machine and deep learning algorithms to cardiovascular science & was applauded by the research community; I received 2 awards from international research bodies.

Prior to that, I completed my undergrad degree in India - Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. I graduated in 2020 with a GPA of 9.91 / 10 , ranking first among 380 students in the department. I graduated with a first class degree and was awarded distinction for my research contributions.

I'm enthusiastic about high quality software, clean code, machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence. When I'm not working on research projects or dreaming about AI for the future, you'll find me writing poems, reading a good novel or predicting the end to a crime mystery series!
