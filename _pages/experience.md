## Software Engineer, Matician, Inc
  _Nov '21 - Present_
  <br>
 **San Francisco Bay Area, California**
 <br>
- Working on computer vision & deep learning algorithms, as an integral member of the Perception Software Team.
- Designed, implemented a computer vision SLAM benchmarking pipeline, using data version control & visualization tools. 
- Automated the calibration of robots, reducing the necessary human-involvement from >1.5 hours to 5 minutes per robot. Pipeline successfully used in > 100 calibrations to date. Tracked, analyzed mechanical causes behind calibration defects - helping mech. engineers design a superior crown.
- Worked on autonomous docking of robots; implemented algorithm able to estimate pose of the dock with < 4cm
translational and negligible rotational error from within 25cm of the dock.
- Integrated stereo camera rectification tests w/ internal UI, allowing anyone to quickly (2-3 mins) test camera calibration.
